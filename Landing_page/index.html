            <p style="color: aqua; letter-spacing:0.08cm;">
                My name is Ayomide Emmanuel Rufai. I was born in August and according to my date of birth, it falls in the virgo ♍ zodiac sign. 
                But i've refused to accept the virgo zodiac sign as it looks feminine 😫 and so i usually attribute myself to the Leo ♌ 🦁zodiac sign. Well it was a thing for me when i was younger, but i don't believe in zodiac signs anymore lol 🙄 because some people go dey ment and they go say na zodiac sign 🤣. 
                <br> 
                I am <a href=""></a> Nigerian, born and brought up in Nigeria and i hail from Ekiti state, I'm Yoruba, but i attribute with every major tribe, so when you meet me, you'd think i'm igbo (if i don't tell you my name). 
                I speak hausa and yoruba the most, i only know afurungunaya, gbafo, kachifo, intutuoma, ifunaya and very important EGO 🤑 in igbo. I know some french, kinda know some french, like a bit, i think you get the point. 
                But yeah after learning all the programming languages i can, i want to go learn more french and be fluent in it, i love the language and maybe russian 👀.
