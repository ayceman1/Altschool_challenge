            <h1 style="color: red;">WHERE DID YOU HEAR ABOUT ALTSCHOOL ?</h1>
            <P style="color: rgb(25, 225, 105);">
                So i've had interest in tech since 2021, specifically coding but never knew how to go about it then, so in 2022 i saw a lady on my contact list post about <a href="https://www.altschoolafrica.com/" target="_blank" title="Altschool Africa website">Altschool Africa</a> and coding. I reached out to her and the discussion started, i opted to join but she said the admission period was over and i couldn't join as of 2021 march.
                Then i reached out to my very close friend who's also a software engineer to make enquiries on how to go about learning coding and he also mentioned <a href="https://www.altschoolafrica.com/" target="_blank" title="Altschool Africa website">Altschool Africa</a> and then told me same thing the lady told me regarding admissions but kept me updated as to when admissions would start. So yeah Mcdave Umoh, also a student of back end engineering track from the previous set officially introduced me to <a href="https://www.altschoolafrica.com/" target="_blank" title="Altschool Africa website">Altschool Africa</a>.

                SAPA sat me down one saturday morning and said "you i will kill you" ü§£ (in lasisi's voice)
                <br>
                Well, i want to make the most out of <a href="https://www.altschoolafrica.com/" target="_blank" title="Altschool Africa website">Altschool Africa</a>, i really do want to learn and know how to code. Infact, no long cap i want to be able to succesfully build and host a good functioning website and web application. I really love how websites and apps are designed, i just want to be actively involved in this tech world, build a great career from it, solve problems and yes make money from it üòâ
                Also, i look forward to making fruitful and reasonable connections with my colleagues, build good relationships too, perhaps my co-founder might be in <a href="https://www.altschoolafrica.com/" target="_blank" title="Altschool Africa website">Altschool Africa</a>. üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
                I'm trying to connect though, i haven't done much based on my busy schedule but there's still time and i look forward to it.
                My major challenge is jurggling work, bnusiness and hustle all at once and learning to code, i was telling someone that, going to school as an adult isn't funny at all, especially if you're fending for yourself, responsibilities are at the apex and then you still have to come back home to practice what you've learnt, sometimes i miss classes and have to watch replays but as a jack of all trades, i know i'll adapt and come out on top.
                For what it's worth, lol i'm literally designing a webpage right now, i have ideas on how they're constructed and i'm making progress and getting better, this is all new to me as i've always been a biological science student all my life and this is physical science involving 0s and 1s, so it's a big change but i'm transitioning fine.
            </P>

            <h3 style="color: red;">CONCLUSION</h3>

                I love what <a href="https://www.altschoolafrica.com/" target="_blank" title="Altschool Africa website">Altschool Africa</a> is doing, changing the narrative, chnaging the perception of education in Africa and i am glad i'm a part of it. I'm glad i got this opportunity. 
                Well, these are what i've learnt so far, i'm working on my knowledge of CSS, so probably the next time i do this, it should look much better with improvements.
